                <li>Diamond is the hardest known natural material on both the Vickers scale and the Mohs scale.</li>
              <li> Diamond's great hardness relative to other materials has been known since antiquity, and is the source of its name. This does not mean that it is infinitely hard, indestructible, or unscratchable.[24] Indeed, diamonds can be scratched by other diamonds[25] and worn down over time even by softer materials, such as vinyl phonograph records.</li>
              <li>The hardness of diamond contributes to its suitability as a gemstone. Because it can only be scratched by other diamonds, it maintains its polish extremely well. Unlike many other gems, it is well-suited to daily wear because of its resistance to scratchingâ€”perhaps contributing to its popularity as the preferred gem in engagement or wedding rings, which are often worn every day.</li>
